UniVirt
=======

University Virtualization (UniVirt) is a software program that will enable users to take a virtual tour of the Francis Quadrangle in the University of Missouri.  The purpose of this program is to give users the experience of visiting the university without spending the time or money required for traveling.  The program uses the Oculus Rift as its means of virtualization.  All persons with access to a computer, an Internet connection, and an Oculus Rift are able to tour the campus at their leisure.  The program can be accessed by downloading it onto a computer that meets the software’s requirements.  The download can be found on UniVirt’s website, along with additional information about the project.  This tour is limited to the Francis Quadrangle, but all of the buildings, features, and its landscape are included in detail.  Users can interact with buildings and other features to learn information about their history.  UniVirt is a program designed to change the way people visit universities.
